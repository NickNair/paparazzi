# Group 5 README

The final versions of the code used in the compteition are located in this branch.

Computer Vision: `sw/airborne/modules/computer_vision/cv_detect_color_object.c`.

Navigation: `sw/airborne/modules/orange_avoider/orange_avoider.c`. 

Note that these are the default directories for the Orange Avoider code, but we simply placed our code in these C files (and corresponding header and xml files) to ensure correct file linking in paparazzi.
