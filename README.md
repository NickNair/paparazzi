# Group 5 README


The final version of our Computer Vision code that was used during the competition is in this branch located under `sw/airborne/modules/computer_vision/cv_detect_color_object.c`.

Our Nagigation code is in `sw/airborne/modules/orange_avoider/orange_avoider.c`. 

Note that these are the default directories for the Orange Avoider code, but we simply placed our code in these C files (and corresponding header and xml files) to ensure correct file linking in paparazzi.
